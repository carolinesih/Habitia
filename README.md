# Habitia

### App Description
Allows users to track daily activities that they want to get into the habit of doing (since it typically takes around 60 days to form a new habit)
First allows users to enter habits that they want to track and uses a timer system to ensure that it happens every day
If user successfully enters it every day, there will be a graph/calendar page that shows their progress; if they miss a day, the streak will turn gray (or something like that) and they get up to 5 grace days if they accidentally miss tracking one
Possible use cases: tracking meds, making bed, washing dishes at end of day, etc.

### App Idea Evaluation

Mobile: Mobile is most conducive to the use case of this app, since it would often be used on the go and for frequent but short periods of time
Story: Doesn't have a major collaborative aspect to it between different people, because its use case is for individual users
Market: any student, but the use case can extend to professionals or other people in general (anyone who wants to work toward a life change)
Habit: strongly builds towards habits, so along with building the habits the user set out to form they would make a habit out of using the app itself for accountability
Scope: The scope is more for individual users than for groups of people at at time, but we could incorporate a synced version for group projects so that everyone receives notifications/contributes to the project every day with everyone able to see other group members' progress and contributions.
